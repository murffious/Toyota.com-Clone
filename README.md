2.  Features and How I did it</br>
####1.2 Features and How I did it</br>

Reverse Engineering Toyota's site was not easy.  </br>
I built out 7 different views in which the user goes through to build and price a vehicle. </br> 
The home screen consists of using ng-repeat to load from my back-end</br></br>
